# python-api-challenge
Scope
The scope for this activity was to understand the weather pattern in relationship with location in order to find an optimal vacation destination.

Part I - WeatherPy
In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

Part 1-WeatherPy
A python script was created on Jupyter notebook and jupyter lab in order to better visualize the data. The weather of 500+ cities were analyzed based on location (Longitud, Latutud) and its location relative to the ecuador.
