# python-api-challenge
Scope
The scope for this activity was to understand the weather pattern in relationship with location in order to find an optimal vacation destination.

Part 1-WeatherPy
A python script was created on Jupyter notebook and jupyter lab in order to better visualize the data. The weather of 500+ cities were analyzed based on location (Longitud, Latutud) and its location relative to the ecuador.

The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot, add a sentence or two explaining what the code is analyzing.
